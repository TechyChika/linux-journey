As someone just starting out in Cloud Engineering, I am excited to share a few hands-on skills I learned recently and trust me, it feels great to finally stop just reading about the cloud and start building in it
Here what I accomplished:

 Set up a virtual machine on AWS EC2
 Launched an instance and connected to it using SSH from the terminal
Ran basic Linux commands like pwd, touch, and mkdir
 Created directories and files, then
Opened and edited a file using Vim (yes, I even figured out how to exit it )

It might sound simple, but for someone new to the cloud and Linux, this was a big confidence booster.
Every command I typed helped me understand a bit more about how cloud servers work under the hood and excited to keep leveling up from here.
