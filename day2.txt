Today I Learned: Managing Users & Groups in Linux
As I continue exploring the world of Cloud Engineering and Linux system administration, I took some time today to learn about a key foundational skill: managing users and groups in a Linux environment.
Heres what I practiced:
  Creating new users with adduser and useradd
   Setting and changing passwords with passwd
    Creating and managing groups with groupadd, usermod, and gpasswd
     Adding users to groups (including the sudo group for admin rights)
      Viewing user details with id and checking login sessions with who and w
       Removing users and groups safely when needed
      It's amazing to see how Linux gives such fine-grained control over system access and user privileges. Understanding this is essential for secure system administration  especially when working with cloud-based servers like AWS EC2.
